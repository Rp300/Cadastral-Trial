Tenant agrees that Tenant's Work within the Premises and all other work undertaken by Tenant in the Premises shall be
performed in a first-class and workmanlike manner and all equipment, fixtures and installation shall be new, or like-
new and in usable condition on the Rent Commencement Date.

F. Pylon Sign. Tenant shall have the right to place its identification panel ("Tenant's Panel") on that area of the
Shopping Center pylon sign crosshatched on the Exhibit 1 attached hereto and made a part hereof ("Pylon Sign").
Tenant shall not install Tenant's Panel on the Pylon Sign until plans and specifications for Tenant's Panel have been
approved in writing by Landlord. Tenant shall, at Tenant's expense, perform all work and supply all installations
necessary to install Tenant's Panel in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by Landlord. No changes
to Tenant's Panel plans and specifications will be made without the prior written consent of Landlord. In the event
Tenant fails to install Tenant's Panel on the Pylon Sign within ninety (90) days following the Rent Commencement
Date, subject to force majeure, Tenant's rights under this Section shall be deemed waived and Tenant shall not have
any further right to place Tenant's Panel on the Pylon Sign.

Tenant agrees, at its expense, to promptly repair Tenant's identification panel in the event of any casualty or other
damage thereto. Tenant further agrees to repair any damage to the Pylon Sign resulting from Tenant's installation or
removal of Tenant's Panel. In the event Tenant fails to repair Tenant's Panel or the Pylon Sign within ten (10) days
after receipt of written notice from Landlord, Landlord may terminate Tenant's rights under this Section F
immediately, effective on the date notice is given to Tenant. In the event of any default by Tenant under the terms of
this Lease, or upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant's right to use the Pylon Sign shall
automatically terminate. In the event Tenant fails to remove Tenant's Panel within ten (10) days after the expiration or
earlier termination of this Lease or after the expiration of the applicable cure period with respect to Tenant's default,
Landlord shall have the right to remove Tenant's Panel at Tenant's expense and dispose of said sign, and Tenant shall
reimburse Landlord upon demand for all costs incurred by Landlord in removing and disposing of Tenant's Panel. If
Tenant fails to repair any damage caused by the installation or removal of Tenant's Panel, Tenant shall pay the cost
thereof to Landlord within fifteen (15) days of Landlord's written demand, together with the sum of fifteen percent
(15%) of said costs for overhead. Tenant's obligations set forth in this Section F shall survive the termination of this
Lease.

Tenant agrees that in no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for failure or interruption of any illumination of the
Pylon Sign or Tenant's Panel, or for any damage to Tenant's Panel unless caused by the gross negligence or intentional
act of Landlord, its agents or employees, and Tenant hereby waives any and all such claims against Landlord.

The foregoing right of Tenant to place Tenant's Panel on the Pylon Sign is personal to, and for the sole benefit of
Tenant, and shall not be transferable to any third party, including without limitation to any assignee of Tenant's rights
under this Lease or any sublessee of the Premises, without the express prior written consent of Landlord, which consent
Landlord may withhold in its sole discretion. Tenant agrees that any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be
null and void.
