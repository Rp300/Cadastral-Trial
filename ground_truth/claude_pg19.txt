any damage or destruction of persons, property or business which shall occur on or about the Premises originating from
any cause whatsoever including the negligence of either party and their respective agents, officers, and employees to
the extent such injury, death or properly damage is required to be covered by a policy or policies maintained by either
Landlord or Tenant pursuant to this Lease. Notwithstanding the above, Landlord and Tenant agree and acknowledge
that the waiver of subrogation herein contained shall expressly extend to and include any uninsured loss paid by the
insured in the form of a deductible or self-funded retention cost.

G. Insurance Charge. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, in monthly installments, in advance on the first day of each
month, the amount specified in Article I, Section 13, as a contribution toward Landlord's cost of carrying public
liability, property damage, fire and extended coverage and such other insurance as Landlord deems appropriate,
including, but not limited to the cost of Landlord's insurance provided in Article XII and any deductible or self-insured
retention costs incurred by Landlord in connection with any loss. Such coverage shall be for those items set forth in
Article XII, Section D, and shall specifically exclude Tenant's personal property.

Tenant's Insurance Charge shall be adjusted on January 1 of each calendar year immediately following the First
Calendar Year (as hereinafter defined) (the "Adjustment Date[s]"), during the term of this Lease and any renewals or
extensions thereof, as follows. Commencing from and including the applicable Adjustment Date, Tenant's Insurance
Charge shall be an amount equal to the sum of the Insurance Charge for the immediately preceding calendar year, plus
five percent (5%) over the Insurance Charge for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of this Article,
the term "First Calendar Year" shall be defined as the period commencing on the Effective Lease Date continuing
through and including the next immediately following December 31.

XIII. DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION

In the event the Premises are damaged by any peril covered by standard policies of fire and extended coverage insurance,
the damage shall, except as hereinafter provided, promptly be repaired by Landlord, at Landlord's expense but, that in no
event shall Landlord be required to repair or replace Tenant's leasehold and building improvements in the Premises
originally constructed by Tenant, Tenant's stock-in-trade, trade fixtures, furniture, furnishings, equipment or personal
property, which shall be the obligation of Tenant to replace to at least equal condition immediately prior to such damage. In
the event (a) the Premises are damaged to the extent of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the cost of replacement of the
Premises, (b) the buildings on the Shopping Center are damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the cost of
replacement, notwithstanding the extent of damages to the Premises, or (c) any damage to the Premises occurs during the
last eighteen (18) months of the term of this Lease or any renewals or extensions, Landlord may elect either to repair or
rebuild the Premises or the buildings on the Shopping Center, as the case may be or to terminate this Lease upon giving
notice of such election in writing to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the event causing the damage. If the casualty,
repairing, or rebuilding shall render the Premises untenantable, in whole or in part, a proportionate abatement of the
Minimum Rent in proportion to the sales floor area of the Premises rendered untenantable shall be allowed until the date
Landlord completes the repairs or rebuilding. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event
damage occurs to the Premises during the last eighteen (18) months of the initial Lease Term, and provided Tenant exercises
its Renewal Period as set forth in Articles I(A)(17) and XXIII(M), and further provided Tenant is not in default under this
Lease, then Landlord shall repair or rebuild the Premises to the extent that Landlord receives insurance proceeds from its
standard policies of fire and extended insurance coverage. Landlord shall commence repair of Tenant's Premises within one
hundred twenty (120) days following the date of such casualty.

If at any time during the last three (3) lease years of the term hereof or any extensions or renewals thereof, the Premises shall
be damaged to the extent of twenty five (25%) or more of the cost of replacement thereof, or if the building of which the
Premises is a part shall be damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the cost of replacement thereof, then, in
either of such events, Tenant shall have the option to terminate this lease upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to
Landlord provided such notice is given within sixty (60) days following the date of such damage.

In the event of damage to the Premises or to the Shopping Center which Landlord is obligated to repair pursuant to this
Article XIII, if Landlord shall not have commenced such repairs within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of the
casualty or , once commenced, should such repairs take longer than twelve (12) months, Tenant may elect to terminate this
lease upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Landlord; provided, however that such right to terminate shall be limited
to a thirty (30) day period following said one hundred twenty (120) days or twelve (12) months, as the case may be.
