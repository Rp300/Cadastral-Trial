5. To operate, manage, equip, light, repair and maintain said Common Areas for their intended purposes in such
manner as Landlord shall in its sole discretion from time to time determine.

Common Area Charge. Beginning thirty (30) days after the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord
as a "Common Area Charge" a proportionate share of all costs and expenses of every kind and nature actually paid or
incurred by Landlord in operating, maintaining, repairing and managing the Common Areas, including but not be
limited to, cleaning, lighting, repairing, painting, maintaining, and replacing all Common Area improvements including
the roofs of all buildings within the Shopping Center; snow removal, landscaping and security; fire safety and
protection systems, monitoring, testing and operating charges; restriping and overlay of the parking lot; painting of
exterior surfaces of Shopping Center buildings; total compensation and benefits (including premiums for Worker's
Compensation and other insurance) paid to or on behalf of employees; personal property taxes; supplies; fire
protection; utility charges; licenses and permit fees; reasonable depreciation of equipment used in operating and
maintaining the Common Areas and rent paid for leasing such equipment, any fees paid or assessed by Landlord for
management of the Shopping Center; and administrative costs equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the total cost of all the
foregoing items. Tenant's Common Area Charge shall be determined by multiplying the total cost incurred by
Landlord by the ratio of the square feet within the Premises to the gross leasable area within all of the buildings in the
Shopping Center existing at the time of such calculation, excluding with respect to any item the square footage of any
tenant in the Shopping Center which provides such item at its own expense for the portion of the Common Areas
within such tenant's demised premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the expiration of the calendar year in
which the term of this Lease shall commence Tenant's annual Common Area Charge in each subsequent calendar year
of the Initial Term of the Lease and any renewals thereof shall not increase by more than seven percent (7%) the
amount payable in the immediately preceding calendar year (on a cumulative basis) during the original Lease Term or
any renewals thereof; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to Landlord's cost of Common Area
snow and ice removal, utilities and security. At the date of this Lease, Tenant's Common Area Charge is calculated to
be .0758% of the total Shopping Center common area charges.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, there shall be excluded or subtracted from or credited against
Common Area Charges, as the case may be, the following:

(a) Repairs or other work occasioned by fire, windstorm or other casualty, to the extent that the costs of which
are reimbursed to Landlord by insurers or by governmental authorities in eminent domain.

(b) Leasing commissions, attorney's fees, costs and disbursements and other expenses incurred in connection
with negotiations for leases with tenants, other occupants of the Shopping Center and similar costs incurred
in connection with disputes between Landlord and tenants of the Shopping Center.

(c) Costs incurred in renovating or otherwise improving or decorating or redecorating space for tenants or other
occupants in the Shopping Center or vacant leasable space in the Shopping Center.

(d) Costs of correcting defects (including latent defects) in the construction of the Shopping Center, parking
area, or other improvements, or in the equipment used therein, except that, for the purposes of this
subparagraph, conditions resulting from ordinary wear and tear and use, fire, casualty, vandalism, and other
matters not occasioned by construction defects shall not be deemed defects.

(e) Depreciation and amortization of Landlord's original investment in capital improvements, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.

(f) Costs (limited to penalties, fines and associated legal expenses) incurred due to the violation by Landlord of
the terms and conditions of the Lease, and applicable to federal, state, and local governmental laws,
ordinances, orders, rules and regulations that would not have been incurred but for any such violation by
Landlord.

(g) Overhead and profit increments paid to subsidiaries of Landlord for services on or to the Shopping Center
(unless credited to the Common Area), any appurtenant parking area, or the property on which the Premises
are located, to the extent that the costs of such services exceed competitive costs for such services rendered
by persons or entities of similar skill, competence and experience, other than a subsidiary of Landlord.

(h) Interest on debt or amortization payments on any mortgage or mortgages, and rental under any ground or
underlying leases or lease (except to the extent the same may be made to pay or reimburse, or may be
measured by, ad valorem taxes).

(i) Except for the Administrative Fee and Management Fee set forth in Article VII B, costs of Landlord's
general corporate overhead and general administrative expenses, which would not be chargeable to Common
Area Charge of the Shopping Center or parking area in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, consistently applied.
