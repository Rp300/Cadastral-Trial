IV. RENT
A. Minimum Rent. Beginning thirty (30) days after the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, at its office or other place as Landlord may from time to time designate, as "Minimum Rent" for the Premises during the term of this Lease, without any deduction or setoff (except as otherwise provided herein), the amount(s) set forth in Schedule A, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month. Minimum Rent and the amounts to be paid by Tenant pursuant to Articles V, VII, and VIII hereof shall be prorated on a per diem basis (based upon a thirty (30) day calendar month) for any partial month included in the first lease year.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Tenant shall not be required to pay Minimum Rent or Additional Rent (as hereafter defined) for any period prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following the Rent Commencement Date.

B. Percentage Rent. Tenant also agrees to pay to Landlord as "Percentage Rent" during each lease year, without any deduction or setoff (except as otherwise provided herein), the percentage of "Gross Sales" in excess of the minimum basis of annual sales set forth in Schedule A. In the event the Minimum Rent is reduced or abated for any reason, the minimum basis of sales shall be reduced proportionately during the period of time the Minimum Rent is reduced or abated.

1. Payment of Percentage Rent. Tenant shall furnish to Landlord on or before the tenth (10th) day of each calendar month, statements of Tenant's Gross Sales (as hereinafter defined) from the Premises for the immediately preceding calendar month. On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the end of each lease year, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord a statement certified by Tenant, of the Gross Sales during the preceding lease year, and concurrently shall pay to Landlord the Percentage Rent due, if any. Failure to provide statements of Gross Sales shall constitute a default under the terms of this Lease and Landlord shall have the right to invoke any or all of Landlord's remedies as set forth in Article XVI. For purposes of calculating Percentage Rent for any partial lease year, the minimum basis of sales shall be prorated on a per diem basis based upon a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year.

2. Gross Sales. The term "Gross Sales" shall mean the aggregate gross amount of all sales of merchandise made and all charges for services performed in, on or from the Premises (including orders accepted in, on or from the Premises for delivery from places other than the Premises, or orders filled from the Premises even though accepted from places other than the Premises, including orders via electronics, telephonic, video, computer or other technology based system whether existing now or developed in the future), whether wholesale or retail, and whether cash or credit, and including the value of all consideration other than money received for any of the foregoing, and all amounts received by Tenant from conducting business in, on or from the Premises, less (a) cash refunds or credit for merchandise returned if the price of such merchandise was originally included in Gross Sales, and (b) the amount of sales and excise taxes to the extent included in sales. Merchandise transferred from the Premises to Tenant's other retail outlet stores open to the public shall not be included in determining Gross Sales. No deduction shall be allowed for uncollected or uncollectible credit or charge accounts. Gross Sales for any period between the Commencement Date and the end of the lease year shall be annualized and Percentage Rent shall be payable in a proportionate amount on the basis of such sales as annualized. Tenant shall be permitted to account for and report Gross Sales in accordance with its customary business and accounting practices.

3. Books of Account. Tenant agrees to prepare and maintain at Tenant's principal office, accurate records of the Gross Sales, which records shall be kept in accordance with accepted accounting practice together with federal, state, and local tax returns of Tenant relating to Tenant's Gross Sales. The foregoing shall be open at all reasonable times to Landlord to enable Landlord to determine the accuracy of the statements of Tenant's Gross Sales during and for four (4) years after the end of the lease year to which the statements relate. In the event an examination or audit of records of Tenant disclosed that Gross Sales as reported in the statements were less, by one percent (1%) or more than the actual Gross Sales for any lease year and the actual Gross Sales were within One Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) of the applicable annual Gross Sales amount set forth in Schedule A of the Lease, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord the reasonable cost of any such examination or audit. Any additional Percentage Rent found due as a result of any examination or audit shall immediately be payable. If such examination or audit discloses a discrepancy of three percent (3%) or more and the actual Gross Sales were within One Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) of the applicable annual Gross Sales amount set forth in Schedule A of the Lease, Landlord shall also have the right to terminate this Lease. Landlord shall have the right
