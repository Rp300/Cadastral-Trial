XVI. DEFAULT BY TENANT
If Tenant defaults in the payment of Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent or other charges and such payment is not made within
ten (10) days following Landlord's written notice that same is due, or if Tenant shall default in the performance of any other
of Tenant's obligations hereunder and Tenant fails to remedy such default within twenty (30) days after written notice from
Landlord, provided that in no event shall Landlord be obligated to provide Tenant with written notice of any non-monetary
default, more than three times per calendar year, or if a receiver of any property of Tenant on the Premises is appointed, or
Tenant's interest in the Premises is levied upon by legal process, or Tenant be adjudged bankrupt and Tenant fails within
thirty (30) days to cause the vacation of such appointment, levy or adjudication, or if Tenant files a voluntary petition in
bankruptcy, disposes of all or substantially all of its assets in bulk, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors,
then and in any such instance, without further notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have the right to exercise any and all rights
or remedies available to Landlord at law, in equity or otherwise, arising from such default, including but not limited to the
right to (i) terminate this Lease, or (ii) enter upon the Premises without terminating this Lease and relet the Premises in
Landlord's name for the account of Tenant for the remainder of the term upon terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to
Landlord and immediately recover from Tenant any deficiency for the balance of the term, plus expenses of reletting. In
addition to the foregoing, any time after such default and the lapse of any applicable notice period, to make such payments
in default or perform such act in default for the account and at the expense of Tenant, and all unpaid Minimum Rent,
Percentage Rent or other charges which are not paid when due and all sums paid by Landlord pursuant to this sentence,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, shall accrue interest at the annual rate of (i) fifteen percent (15%), or (ii) five percent
(5%) above the prime lending rate of National City Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, whichever is greater, which shall constitute
additional rent under this Lease and shall be payable upon demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall have no
duty to mitigate the damages suffered by Landlord rising from the default by Tenant of any of its obligations under this
Lease. If Tenant shall issue a check to Landlord which is dishonored by Tenant's depository bank and returned unpaid for
any reason, including without limitation, due to insufficient funds in Tenant's checking account, Tenant shall pay to
Landlord in addition to any other rights or remedies available to Landlord at law, the sum of Seventy-five and 00/100
Dollars ($75.00) for Landlord's administrative expense in connection therewith.

Tenant's failure to pay Rent, Additional Rent, or any other Lease costs when due under this Lease may cause Landlord to
incur unanticipated costs. The exact amount of such costs are impractical or extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs
may include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by
any ground lease, mortgage, or deed of trust encumbering the Shopping Center. Therefore, if Landlord does not receive the
Rent, Additional Rent, or any other Lease costs in full on or before the tenth (10th) day of the month it becomes due, Tenant
shall pay Landlord a late charge, which shall constitute liquidated damages, equal to One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) a
day for each month rent is late after the first of the month ("Late Charge"), which shall be paid to Landlord together with
such Rent, Additional Rent, or other Lease costs then in arrears. The parties agree that such Late Charge represents a fair
and reasonable estimate of the cost Landlord will incur by reason of such late payment. All Late Charges and any returned
check charges shall then become Additional Rent and shall be due and payable immediately along with such other Rent,
Additional Rent, or other Lease costs then in arrears. Money paid by Tenant to Landlord shall be applied to Tenant's
account in the following order: (i) to any unpaid Additional Rent, including, without limitation, Late Charges, returned
check charges, legal fees and/or court costs legally chargeable to Tenant, and Common Area Maintenance Charges, and then
(ii) to unpaid Minimum Rent. Nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to compel Landlord to accept any payment
of Rent, Additional Rent, or other Lease costs in arrears or Late Charge or returned check charge should Landlord elect to
apply its rights and remedies available under this Lease or at law or equity in the event of default hereunder by Tenant.
Landlord's acceptance of Rent, Additional Rent, or other Lease costs in arrears or Late Charge or returned check charge
pursuant to this clause shall not constitute a waiver of Landlord's rights and remedies available under this Lease or at law or
equity.
