In the event the Reduced Minimum Rent Period shall expire and the Occupant continues to violate the Exclusive Use,
then Tenant's sole remedy shall be either (i) to terminate the Lease or (ii) remain in possession of the Premises and
continue to operate its business therein.

(ii) Terminate. In the event Landlord shall violate the Exclusive Use, and the Occupant continues to violate the
Exclusive Use beyond the Reduced Minimum Rent Period, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving
Landlord written notice of termination within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the Reduced Minimum Rent
Period. Termination of the Lease shall be effective thirty (30) days after the date Landlord receives Tenant's notice of
termination (the "Termination Date"), provided that Tenant pays to Landlord all sums and charges due and owing by
Tenant to Landlord through and including the Termination Date, including but not limited to Minimum Rent,
Percentage Rent, Additional Charges and any other amount due hereunder. Any sum which cannot be exactly
determined by Landlord as of the Termination Date shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within thirty (30) days after
receipt by Tenant of a statement for said sums. The obligation of Tenant to pay any such sums shall survive the
termination of this Lease. In the event Tenant shall not terminate this Lease within the thirty (30) day period set forth
above, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Lease unless a subsequent breach of the
Exclusive Use shall occur. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event the Exclusive Use
shall be violated by another Shopping Center tenant because said tenant is operating in its premises in default of its
permitted use as set forth in such tenant's lease, Landlord shall not be deemed to have violated Tenant's Exclusive Use,
and Tenant shall not have the right to terminate this Lease, so long as Landlord is diligently attempting to enjoin such
tenant from violating Tenant's Exclusive Use.

In the event Tenant ceases to operate sell at retail, bagels, bakery products, deli sandwiches and deli meats as its
Principal Business for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days, this Article IX, Section C, and Tenant's rights
hereunder shall automatically become null and void and of no further force and effect.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event the Exclusive Use shall be violated by another
Shopping Center tenant because said tenant is operating in its premises in default of its permitted use as set forth in
such tenant's lease ("Other Violating Tenant"), Landlord shall have a period of seventy five (75) days following
Tenant's notice ("Cure Period") to commence and diligently prosecute an action to enjoin such violation, provided,
however, Landlord shall have no obligation to appeal the judgment beyond the trial court level. In the event Landlord
fails to cure such default within the Cure Period, then, in such event, Tenant's right to revert to Substitute Rent shall be
retroactive to the date the Tenant provided notice to the Landlord of the violation of the Exclusive Use and shall be
recalculated on such basis, and Tenant shall be allowed to offset against Substitute Rent coming due after Landlord's
Cure Period any rents and other payments paid by Tenant for periods prior to the expiration of Landlord's Cure Period
that are in excess of Substitute Rent for Landlord's Cure Period. The payment of Substitute Rent shall continue until
the earlier to occur of (i) the date Tenant is not longer operating as a bagel restaurant as its Primary Business or (ii) the
date the Other Violating Tenant ceases to violate the Exclusive Use. Tenant's obligation to pay Minimum Rent,
Percentage Rent, Common Area Charge, Real Estate taxes and Insurance Charge set forth in this Lease shall thereafter
be fully reinstated without any obligation of prior notice thereof by Landlord to Tenant.
