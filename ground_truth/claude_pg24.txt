time of exercise, Landlord hereby grants to Tenant the option to renew this Lease for the periods set forth in Article I,
Section 17, commencing on the day following the expiration of the original term. Any such Renewal Term shall be
upon all the terms and conditions as the original Lease Term except that the Minimum Rent and the Percentage Rent
shall be increased in accordance with the terms of Article I, Section 17. It shall be a condition to Tenant's right to
renew this Lease pursuant to this Section (M) that Tenant provide Landlord (i) Tenant's current financial statement
within thirty (30) days following the date Tenant shall exercise the foregoing option to renew this Lease.

The foregoing option to renew shall be exercised by written notice to Landlord given not less than the number of
months set forth in Article I, Section 17, above prior to the expiration of the original term of this Lease, or any renewal
thereof.

N. Net Rent. It is the intention of Landlord and Tenant that the rent herein specified shall be net to Landlord in each year
of the term hereof, and that all costs, expenses and obligations relating to the Premises (except as herein specifically
provided) shall be paid by Tenant.

O. Counterparts. This Lease may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all
of which shall constitute one document.

P. Consents. With respect to any provision of this Lease which provides or infers, in effect, that Landlord shall not
unreasonably withhold or unreasonably delay its consent or approval, Tenant, in no event, shall be entitled to make,
nor shall Tenant make, any claim against Landlord for money damages, and Tenant hereby waives any claim or
assertion by Tenant that Landlord has unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed any consent or approval, but
Tenant's sole remedy shall be an action or proceeding to enforce any such provision of this Lease, or for specific
performance, injunction or declaratory judgment.

Q. Force Majeure. In the event Landlord or Tenant is prevented or delayed in the performance of any improvement or
repair or fulfilling any other obligation required under this Lease due to delays caused by fire, catastrophe, strikes or
labor trouble, civil commotion, acts of God, governmental prohibitions or regulation, inability or difficulty to obtain
materials or other causes beyond the performing party's reasonable control, the performing party shall, within five (5)
days of the event causing such delay, provide written notice to the other party of the event causing the delay and the
anticipated period of delay, and the period of such delay shall be added to the time for performance thereof. The
performing party shall have no liability by reason of such permitted delays. In the event the performing party fails to
provide notice to the other party of the force majeure delay within such five (5) day period, the performing party shall
not be excused from the timely performance of such obligation regardless of the cause.

R. Joint and Several Liability. In the event Tenant shall be comprised of more than one (1) individual or business entity,
each such individual or business entity comprising Tenant shall be jointly and severally liable for each and every
obligation of Tenant under the terms of this Lease.

of money to be paid by Tenant to Landlord under the provisions hereof, Tenant shall make such payment "under
protest" and under no circumstances shall Tenant be entitled to withhold any payment due hereunder. If Tenant makes
a payment "under protest" and it is subsequently determined that Tenant was not obligated to pay all or a portion of an
amount paid "under protest," Landlord shall refund to Tenant the portion of the payment made "under protest" which
Tenant was not obligated to pay.

out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant or Tenant's use or occupancy
of the Premises.
