Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge that electrical service to the Premises may be furnished by one or more
companies providing electrical generation, transmission and/or distribution services. Landlord hereby reserves the
right to charge Tenant for the cost of electrical service to the Premises as a single charge or divided into and billed in a
variety of categories such as distribution charges, transmission charges, generation charges, public good charges or
other similar categories. Landlord further reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to select the company(ies) providing
electrical service(s) to the Shopping Center, including the Premises, to aggregate the electrical service for the Premises
and other premises within the Shopping Center, to purchase electricity for the Shopping Center, including the
Premises, through a broker and/or buyers group and to change the providers and/or manner of purchasing electricity
from time to time. Landlord shall be entitled to receive a reasonable fee (if permitted by law) for the services provided
by Landlord in connection with the selection of utility companies and the negotiation and administration of contracts
for the generation of electricity to the Shopping Center. In addition, if Landlord bills Tenant directly for the cost of
electricity service to the Premises, the cost of electricity service may include (if permitted by law) an administrative fee
to reimburse Landlord for the cost of reading meters, preparing invoices and related costs. In no event, however, shall
the cost of such utility service(s) supplied by Landlord, exceed a rate which Tenant would otherwise pay for such
utility service(s) if Tenant obtained such utility service(s) directly from the most economical and available utility
supplier.

B. Rubbish Disposal. Landlord reserves the right to implement a uniform program of rubbish removal which shall be
applicable to all tenants in the Shopping Center, exclusive of major tenants. Landlord shall implement such program
by (i) the initial acquisition by purchase or lease of disposal facilities, including but not limited to, compactor(s), baling
machine(s) and/or incinerator(s), and the cost of initial acquisition and installation of such equipment or facilities shall
be reimbursable to Landlord within thirty (30) days from receipt of Landlord's invoice based upon a proration from
each tenant according to the projected use of such facilities, (ii) the implementation of uniform and objective rules and
regulations for the storage, separation and disposal of rubbish, and (iii) establishment of guidelines for the scheduled
and permitted uses of any such facilities, alternate methods of disposing of any rubbish which is not compatible with
the facility, and a schedule of costs and fees to each tenant for the use of said facilities (inclusive of the cost of any
required maintenance of such facilities and the cost of removal of the by-product from the Shopping Center).
Landlord, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to retain the services of an independent consultant the cost of which
shall be included in the total cost of the program. Landlord reserves the right to utilize the facilities to dispose of
Common Area rubbish and such cost, if any, shall be included in the Common Area charge.

The foregoing provision of this Article VIII, Section B, to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant shall not be obligated
to participate in any rubbish disposal program of Landlord or pay any costs under this Section B, if the costs payable
by Tenant under this Section B are greater than the costs Tenant would pay for such rubbish disposal services if
Tenant obtained such service directly from a local provider.

In no event shall Landlord be liable for the quality, quantity, failure, or interruption of the foregoing utility and rubbish
disposal services to the Premises.

business described in Article I(A), Section 4, above, except where Tenant is prevented from doing so by strikes,

the public during such extended hours as Landlord may establish for the Shopping Center during recognized holiday
seasons and any special promotional events, provided that a majority of the other existing non-anchor tenants are open
during such extended hours. Tenant recognizes it is a material consideration to Landlord that Tenant produce the
