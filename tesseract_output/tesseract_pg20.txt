XIV. ASSIGNING AND SUBLETTING

XV.

Tenant shall not sublet the Premises or any part thereof nor assign this Lease without in each case the prior written consent
of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld provided that each of the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) Tenant shall not be in default under any of the terms and conditions of this Lease at the time of the proposed subletting or
assignment; (ii) the sublessee or assignee shall occupy the Premises and conduct its business therein provided, however, that
{a) such business use shall not conflict with any other Shopping Center tenants’ use of such tenants’ premises including
without limitation thereto, any exclusive rights granted to any other tenant in the Shopping Center, and (b) such business
use shall not, in Landlord's reasonable discretion, have a negative effect on the current tenant mix or reputation of the
Shopping Center; (iii) in the case of an assignment only, the net worth of the proposed assignee as of the date of such
assignment shall be equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant (and Guarantor, if any) as the date of this Lease; (iv)
Tenant and its assignee or sublessee, as the case may be, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a fully
executed counterpart of the written assignment of lease or sublease within ten (10) days of the date thereof; and (v) in the
event the proposed assignment or sublease provides for, or Tenant otherwise receives rent or other consideration in excess
of that provided for in this Lease (calculated on a per square foot basis), Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such
excess as it is received by or becomes due to Tenant. Tenant shall not permit any business to be operated in or from the
Premises by any concessionaire or licensee without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent Landlord may
withhold in its sole discretion. In the event Tenant shall request Landlord's consent to an assignment of this Lease or
subletting of the Premises, Tenant shall pay Landlord, as a condition to obtaining Landlord’s consent the reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by Landlord to review and/or prepare documents in connection with such assignment or sublease
(including Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees) and, in addition, a consent fee of One Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
($1,000.00) per request, regardless of whether such assignment or sublease is consummated by Tenant. No consent by
Landlord shall operate to relieve Tenant and/or Guarantor, if any, from primary liability for the performance of Tenant's
obligations under this Lease.

Any sale, assignment, bequest, inheritance, transfer or other disposition of shares of Tenant's corporate stock which shall
result in a change in the effective voting control of Tenant by the person or persons owning a majority of said corporate
shares on the date of this Lease shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease requiring Landlord's prior written consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, if Tenant is a corporation, (i) a transfer of stock among the current stockholders of
Tenant as of the date of this Lease, or (ii) a transfer of stock among the current stockholders of Tenant and their immediate
families (i.e. Spouse, parent, brother, sister, children, grandchildren), or (iii) any spouse of any such parent, brother, sister,
children or grandchildren, or (iv) a transfer of stock by Will, devise or gift, or (v) a transfer of stock in connection with a
public offering registered with the Securities Exchange Commission provided management remains substantially the same,
shall not constitute an assignment for purposes of this Lease.

EMINENT DOMAIN

In the event the Shopping Center or any part thereof shall be taken or condemned either permanently or temporarily for any
public or quasi-public use or purpose by any authority in appropriate proceedings or by any right of eminent domain, the
entire compensation award thereof, including, but not limited to, all damages as compensation for diminution in value of the
leasehold, reversion and fee, shall belong to Landlord, without any deduction therefrom for any present or future estate of
Tenant, and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all its right, title, and interest to any such award. Tenant shall have the right
to recover from the condemning authority, but not from Landlord, such compensation as may be separately awarded to
Tenant.

In the event of a taking under the power of eminent domain of (i) more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Premises or
(ii) a sufficient portion of the Shopping Center so that after such taking less than fifty percent (50%) of the leasable floor
area within all buildings located on the Shopping Center (as constituted prior to such taking) are occupied by tenants, either
Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by notice in writing given within ninety (90) days after the
condemning authority takes possession, in which event all rents and other charges shall be prorated as of the date of such
termination.

In the event of a taking of any portion of the Premises not resulting in a termination of this Lease, Landlord shall use so
much of the proceeds of Landlord's award for the Premises as is required therefor to restore the Premises to a complete
architectural unit and this Lease shall continue in effect with respect to the balance of the Premises, with a reduction of
Minimum Rent in proportion to the portion of the Premises taken.
